Definitely not a shell

## Disclaimer

Just my experiments, ideas and some links

Will document if get anything interesting here

## Repeatative tasks

* lookup clojure doc


# Design descisions

### 5-7 things in context
app switcher should operate only on 5 things

### Take hotkeys from emacs/bash
to make it easier to use it by old-school terminal users


## Ideas

### In-place vs persistent

Make it possible to persist some temporary created stuff. In-place editing for
drafting. cvs for prooved features.

### ???

Some list should be displayed horizontally (list of images previews for example)

### structured data editor


Main targets: yaml/edn/markdown/json

### file browser

ivy like

### Modes

* `SPC w l` - window left
* `SPC W` - set window-managing-mode (all window hotkeys available without `SPC
w` prefix)

wm. Good idea of window switching, can be used for window-management mode.
Focused/selected windows are highlighted, other blured or shadowed.
